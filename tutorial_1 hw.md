# WIX1002  Fundamentals of Programming
# Tutorial 1 Problem Solving in Programming

Build the pseudocode and flow chart for each of the problems:

## Part I
1.Request two numbers from the users and print the multiplication of the numbers.
```
Get the first number
Get the second number
Multiply the first number with second number
Print the multiplication of the two numbers
```
2.Determine whether a random number is greater than 50.
```
Generate a random number
if the mark is more than 50
  Print "Greater than 50"
otherwise
  Print "Less than or equal to 50"
```
3.Print the pass/fail grade based on the mark entered by user. The passing mark is at least 40.
```
Get the mark
if the mark is more than or equal to 40
  Print "Pass"
otherwise
  Print "Fail"
```
4.Print the results of the two players' dice game.
```
Read dice1 and dice2
if dice1 > dice2
  Print "Player1 wins"
else if dice2 > dice1
  Print "Player2 wins"
else
  Print "tie"
```
5.Print the perimeter of a rectangle.
```
Get the width of rectangle
Get the length of rectangle 
Perimeter of rectangle = 2*width of rectangle + 2*length of rectangle
Print perimeter of rectangle
```
6.Print the minimum number from 10 random numbers generated by computer.
```
Generate a random number
Assign the random number as the minimum number
Initialise counter as 1 
while counter <= 10
  Generate a random number
  if the random number < the minimum number
    Assign the random number as the minimum number
  Increase the counter by 1
Print the minimum number
```
7.Print the number of odd and even number from 10 random numbers generated by computer.The range of the random number is from 10-100.
```
Initialise oddNumber as 0 and evenNumber as 0
Initialise counter as 1
while the counter <= 10
  Generate a random number from 10-100
  if the random number %2 = 0 
    increase evenNumber by 1
  otherwise
    increase oddNumber by 1
Print oddNumber and evenNumber
```

## Part II
8.Count the number of alphabet U and M from a sentence entered by user.
```
