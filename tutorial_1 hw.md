1.Request two numbers from the users and print the multiplication of the numbers.
```
Get the first number
Get the second number
Multiply the first number with second number

Generate a random number
If the mark is more than 50
  Print "Greater than 50"
Otherwise
  Print "Less than or equal to 50"
```
3.Print the pass/fail grade based on the mark entered by user. The passing mark is at least 40.
