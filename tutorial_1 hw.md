# WIX1002  Fundamentals of Programming
# Tutorial 1 Problem Solving in Programming

Build the pseudocode and flow chart for each of the problems:

## Part I
1.Request two numbers from the users and print the multiplication of the numbers.
```
Get the first number
Get the second number
Multiply the first number with second number
Print the multiplication of the two numbers
```
2.Determine whether a random number is greater than 50.
```
Generate a random number
if the number is greater than 50
  Print "Greater than 50"
otherwise
  Print "Less than or equal to 50"
```
3.Print the pass/fail grade based on the mark entered by user. The passing mark is at least 40.
```
Get the mark
if the mark is more than or equal to 40
  Print "Pass"
otherwise
  Print "Fail"
```
4.Print the results of the two players' dice game.
```
Read dice1 and dice2
if dice1 > dice2
  Print "Player1 wins"
else if dice2 > dice1
  Print "Player2 wins"
else
  Print "tie"
```
5.Print the perimeter of a rectangle.
```
Get the width of rectangle
Get the length of rectangle 
Perimeter of rectangle = 2*width of rectangle + 2*length of rectangle
Print perimeter of rectangle
```
6.Print the minimum number from 10 random numbers generated by computer.
```
Generate a random number
Assign the random number as the minimum number
Initialise counter as 1 
while counter <= 10
  Generate a random number
  if the random number < the minimum number
    Assign the random number as the minimum number
  Increase the counter by 1
Print the minimum number
```
7.Print the number of odd and even number from 10 random numbers generated by computer.The range of the random number is from 10-100.
```
Initialise oddNumber as 0 and evenNumber as 0
Initialise counter as 1
while the counter <= 10
  Generate a random number from 10-100
  if the random number %2 = 0 
    increase evenNumber by 1
  otherwise
    increase oddNumber by 1
Print oddNumber and evenNumber
```

## Part II
8.Count the number of alphabet U and M from a sentence entered by user.
```
Get a sentence from the user
Initialise alphabetU as 0 and alphabetM as 0
Intialise an index that point to the first character of the sentence
while the index is less than the length of the sentence
  Read the character according to the index 
  if the character is U
    increase alphabetU by 1
  else if the character is M
    increase alphabetM by 1
  increase the index by 1
Print alphabetU and alphabetM
```
9.Display the frequency of a keyword from a web page.
```
Initialise frequency as 0
Get a keyword from the user
Read from a webpage
while the web page is not end of the file
  Read one line from the page 
  for each word in the line
    if the word is equal to the keyword
      increase frequency by 1
Print the frequency
```
10.Display the number of female student from a random list of 100 students.
```
Initialise counter as 1 
while the counter <= 100
  Generate a random student with gender
  Store the student in the list
  increase the counter by 1
Initialise femaleStudent as 0
for each student in the list
  if the gender is female
    increase femaleStudent by 1
Print femaleStudent
```
11.Display a list of 5 random numbers in descending order
```
Initialise counter as 1
while the counter <= 5
  Generate a random number
  Store the number in the list
  Increase the counter by 1
Initialise an iteration as 1 
while the iteration is less than the total number in the list
  for each number in the list
    if the current number is greater than the next number
      Assign the current number to the temporary number
      Assign the next number to the current number
      Assign the temporary number to the next number
  Increase the iteration by 1
for each number in the list
  Print the number
```
12.Guess a random number generated by computer.
```
Get a number from the user
Generate a random number
while the guess number is not equal to the random number
  if the guess number > random number
    Print "Too high"
  otherwise
    Print "Too low"
  Get another number from the user
Print "Correct"
```
